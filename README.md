# odin-sign-up-form

The goal is to create a sign-up form for an imaginary service using maximum of tools I've learned so far, especially the latest.\
So I want to make a form with good design and high accessibility, use new for me CSS variables, functions, and set up color themes.

Thanks SVGBackgrounds.com for the image with mountains.
